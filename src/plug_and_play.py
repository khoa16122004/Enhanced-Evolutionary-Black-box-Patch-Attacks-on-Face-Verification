🎯 DETECTIVE CHALLENGE 🎯  
You are the detective. Two witnesses each see one face. They don’t know the other face exists.  
Ask ONE highly specific question about a concrete facial feature that helps eliminate or confirm identity — like in a decision tree.  
Each question should split possibilities and guide you closer to the answer.  
DO NOT ask if things are “same” or “similar”.  
ONLY return the next best question to ask BOTH witnesses.
